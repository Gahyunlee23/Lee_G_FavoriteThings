    <h2>Favorite Queer Movies</h2>
    <p>
        Watching movies is my favorite hobby. 
        Whenever I have time, I always go to the theater or browsing movies on Netflix. 
        I have my movie lists by categories such as emotion, weather, or genre. 
        This list that I picked for the favorite thing is the queer movies by seasons. 
        Each film is shooted in spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively. 
        Unfortunately, I can introduce only three movies because of the instruction, so I omit the video for fall.
